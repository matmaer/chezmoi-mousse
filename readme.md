Terminal user interface for [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi), visualizing its operations. Built with [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual). The name of the repository is a wink to the mouse.

The TUI uses your locally installed chezmoi executable, it is not meant to be used as a starting point to use chezmoi, nor as a replacment. The TUI is aimed at existing Chemoi users, open to some convenience by means of visualisations. This includes presenting diffs and noting or running the related commands for the visualization at hand.
